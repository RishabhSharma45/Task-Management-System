# Task-Management-System
The Task Management System is a simple Java-based application that utilizes modern Java 8 features to manage and organize tasks effectively. It demonstrates the practical use of Lambda expressions, Functional Interfaces like Predicate, Function, Consumer, Supplier, and Comparator, as well as the Stream API and the new Date and Time API introduced in Java 8. This project serves as an excellent reference for understanding how functional programming paradigms can be integrated into Java applications.

# Features
Task Creation: Add tasks with specific titles and deadlines.
Task Management: Mark tasks as completed.
Task Filtering: Filter tasks based on completion status or custom criteria.
Task Sorting: Sort tasks by their deadline dates.
Console Output: Review tasks directly through a simple console output interface.

# Technologies Used
Java 8: Utilizes Java 8 features extensively including lambda expressions and stream API.
Maven: Managed dependencies and project build configuration.

# Usage
Once the application is running, it will automatically add some sample tasks and display them. You can modify the main method in the TaskManager class to customize task creation, adjust filtering logic, or change how tasks are sorted and displayed.
